# Section 3.0: Branching

* create a new branch in your research paper repo called `methodology` and
checkout to it
* check out a previous commit on that branch. We discussed `detached HEAD`
state before. What does it look like? Try `git log` and `git status` in this
state. Discuss with your partner the different ways you'd go back to the most
recent commit of the `methodology` branch. Try them out. use `git status` and `git
log` to help you.
* After this, `git checkout methodology`
* Edit the metholology.md file. Try to write a bit about how python is going to be used for the work that you do, and what python packages are going to be used to make that happen. Add it to staging and commit it.
* Go back to the master branch. Try to delete the `methodology` branch with `git
branch -d`. What does it look like?
