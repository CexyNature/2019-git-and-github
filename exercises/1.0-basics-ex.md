# Section 1.0:

* set your config settings for your user name and email.
* check your config settings. Do you see anything interesting? What text editor
are we using in this workshop?
* If you haven't yet, create a github user account. Make sure the e-mail
address matches whatever you set in your config settings.
* check your configuration settings with `git config --list`
* navigate into a directory where you want to store repositories that makes
sense to you. (e.g. I like to store all git repos in a folder called ~/repos/)
* clone our example repository for this lesson at:
  https://github.com/munkm/aspp-apac-paper.git
* Explore the log of the repository
* create a new file called introduction.md and edit it to include a
one-sentence introduction for a paper on your research and how it relates to  
scientific python.
* check the status of this file
* add the file to the staging area
* check the status of the file
* commit the file
* add your name to authors.md, then commit the file. We're working on this paper together after all!
* check the log of the repository again. Does it look different? How?
