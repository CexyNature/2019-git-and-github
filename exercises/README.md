Let's assume we're all writing a paper to a forward-thinking journal that plans
to have the entire paper written and reviewed with version control and on
github. This journal is also very permissive and is allowing you to write
everything in markdown (wow! So cool!). Right now, you're about to go to an
internet-free writing retreat. You have collaborators on your paper that have
already started the collaborative writing repository, so you're going to clone
the repo before you leave, and then version-controlling your writing on your
computer without github for a while.
