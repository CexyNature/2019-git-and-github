# Section 6.0: remotes:

* check the remote URL with `git remote -v`
* make a fork of the example repository associated with this lesson to your
github user account.
* remove the remote origin
* add the fork of this project as `origin` to your local repository
* add the URL of my repository (the upstream) to a remote called munkm
* push your local master branch up to `origin`
* check on github that the history matches what you see on your local machine.
* fetch munkm/master
* merge munkm/master into your local master
* push this updated master to your new `origin`
* look at your remote repository on github. Does anything interesting show up
now that you've pushed these changes?
