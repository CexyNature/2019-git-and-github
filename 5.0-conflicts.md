# 5.0 Conflicts  

Sometimes we can't automatically merge a branch into its desired destination.
git is smart, but sometimes it's much more obvious to a human what should
be removed in a conflict.
When that happens git will notify us that we have to do a merge conflict
resolution.  

In `AUTHORS.md` I've added some descriptions of my dissertation committee
members on a branch called `authors` but on the `master` branch I've added their
actual names. When I try to merge, git notifies me of the issue:

```
$ git branch
  master
* authors
$ git merge master
Auto-merging AUTHORS.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in AUTHORS.md
Recorded preimage for 'AUTHORS.md'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

If I open `AUTHORS.md`, we can see that git has modified the file to
include the
changes from both branches. By navigating to the segment between where git has
added `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>> branchname` you can see what the conflicts
are. Now I need to choose which changes I want to
incorporate for this merge.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
My committee has the following people
* My national lab colleague
* Another professor in my research area
* The guy who wrote the spherical cow book
=======
My committee members are:
* Dr. T
* Prof. M
* Prof. J
>>>>>>> master
```

To do this, I need to delete everything out of the file except what I want to
keep. My process looks like this:

```
$ vi AUTHORS.md
$ git status
On branch authors
You have unmerged paths.
  (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
  (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

Unmerged paths:
  (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

	both modified:   AUTHORS.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git add AUTHORS.md
$ git status
On branch merge-branch
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:

	modified:   AUTHORS.md
$ git commit -m 'merge master into authors'
Recorded resolution for 'AUTHORS.md'.
[authors 0d253a2] merge master
```

Note that the prompt here that git shows is is very similar to that of a
standard file modification, but we see some additional wording, like
> You have unmerged paths.
> All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.

Remember that git always tries to be helpful, so reading what's returned
by `git status` can be useful to us figuring out what to do.

tips:
* you can always abort a merge if you realize you're not ready with `git merge
--abort`.
* short lines make merge conflicts much easier. If you don't have hard wrapping
set in your text editor, you may have a merge conflict that looks like an
entire paragraph.


# Interlude: local vs. remote git

Up until this point, we've done exclusively command-line git. All of this has
been on our *local machine*. We could be version-controlling our work and no
person in the world could access it. Local version control is still helpful! We
can go back to previous states and manage our own work, but we don't have a
remote backup (unless you're keeping your git repository in a google drive
folder or something, but that's unnecessary). Local git is great because you
don't need internet access. You don't need a github account! You just need git
and your computer.

Using git + a remote backup allows us broader options than version controlling
our work on our local computer. We have a remote backup that will safely store
our work. If our computer gets stolen (or if you're like me and maybe
accidentally spill coffee on your computer), we can re-clone our work and start
right where we left off on a brand new machine!  

There are many remote backups that exist for git. `github`, `gitlab`,
`bitbucket`, or even a local server will allow you to back up your repository.
Each of these options differs slightly. Today I'll be focusing on using github
as a remote system.

Github allows us to not only store remote copies of our work, but also to
collaborate and manage our repository on the web. Earlier we did command-line
based conflict resolutions. Github has tools to do conflict resolutions on their
site, allowing for colleagues that may not be as confident with command-line
based workflows to still contribute to OSS. To use github, and to backup our
repository we need to have an internet connection. We only need the internet
connection when we're directly interacting with our remote -- to continue adding
and committing locally we still don't require an internet connection. But to
re-sync local changes up to github we'll need that connection. As we move into
the next section I'll be showing how our local and remote git histories change
as we make changes in our repository.

Consistently pushing our commits to github has an additional bonus: no matter
how much we might mess up our local working copy, we can always get a fresh
clone from github.
