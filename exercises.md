# Section 1.0:

Let's assume we're all at a forward-thinking university that plans to have your entire dissertation written and reviewed with version control and on github. Your university is also very permissive and is allowing you to write everything in markdown (wow! So cool!). Right now, you're at a internet-free writing retreat, so you're going to start version-controlling your work on your computer without github for a while.

* set your config settings for your user name, email, and text editor options (please see the course notes for how to set your preferred editor)
* create a new folder for your dissertation writing project in a location that makes sense on your computer
* navigate into this directory
* initialize git in this directory, now a repository
*

# Section 3.0:

* create a new branch in your dissertation repo called `appendices` and checkout to it
* check out a previous commit on that branch. We discussed `detached HEAD` state before. What does it look like? Try `git log` and `git status` in this state. Discuss with your partner the different ways you'd go back to the tip of `appendices`. Try them out.
* Make a new file related to an appendix you plan to put in your dissertation. Add some text to it, then add it to staging and commit it.
* Go back to the master branch. Try to delete the `appendices` branch with `git branch -d`. What does it look like? 

# Section 4.0:

# Section 5.0:

# Section 6.0:

* create new project on github for your dissertation
* add this project as `origin` to your local repository
* push your local master branch up to `origin`
* `fetch` and `merge`
