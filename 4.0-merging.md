# 4.0 Merging

Covered commands + concepts:

* `git merge [branchname]`
* merging vs. rebasing

Git merge is a powerful tool in our git arsenal. We use git merge to
incorporate the changes in one branch to another. A bit later we'll go over
merging things other than local branches.

Let's say we have the same two branches that have been worked on as shown
previously. We're on the branch master:

and we can merge testing into it:

From there, we can continue working. All commits in this diagram will show up
in our history with git log.

A quick aside on rebasing:

Some projects prefer to use a rebase-based method for development.
