# 7.0 Collaboration

* forking
* pull requests
* issues
* comparing changes
* `git fetch` and `git merge` with multiple remotes
* tagging issues in PRs

Often we will have changes on our remote that aren't on our local machine yet. There are a few ways we can get these changes pulled into our local machine effectively. First, `git fetch` will copy the remote changes into our git folder. `git fetch` on its own will copy all of the remote branches and stores them as remote tracking branches. We can see them with `git branch -a`. As an example, I'm going to fetch a repository I haven't updated in a few days. I have my fork, `origin`, and I have the upstream package that I forked that I named `upstream`. First I'll fetch upstream:

```
$ git fetch upstream
remote: Enumerating objects: 32, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (27/27), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Total 16 (delta 12), reused 8 (delta 6), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (16/16), done.
From https://github.com/yt-project/yt
   2fa8519dd..29005b829  master     -> upstream/master
```

We can see the commit references between master and upstream/master as `2fa8519dd..29005b829`. We can look at all the commits between master and upstream/master with the log:

```
$ git log --oneline master..upstream/master

We can expand this a bit to see where HEAD is pointed.

```

You can see the commit IDs in this log between master and upstream/master reflect those that were returned with the fetch command. We can also see that my fork, origin/master is at the same point as my local copy of master. Let's merge upstream/master into master and see how the log changes.

```
$ git merge upstream/master

now we can see that my local copy of master is pointed to the same place as upstream/master. We can update my fork with git push:

$ git push origin master

```

Now our local copy, our fork, and our project's repository all have master
pointed to the same commit.  

aside: this is why branching is powerful. If we're working in a branch that's
constantly being updated with remote changes, we'll have to fetch and merge and
potentially perform a lot of conflict resolutions. We don't have to do that if
we're working in a thematic branch.

A fork is a copy of a repository associated with your user account (or another
organization). Earlier in the lesson we were pushing changes up to our
individual github accounts. However, you don't always have git commit rights to
different repositories. We don't want random people going and changing our
research code or our research papers! Forks help us by allowing people to copy
our code and make changes separately, and we can integrate those changes in our
own time.

Earlier we talked about `git fetch` and `get merge`. These two commands together
are `git pull`. A pull request is a request from a user for the a collaborator
or organization to pull (or fetch and merge) their changes into their own
repository. This is the way that we incorporate our work into another repository
without commit rights. Pull requests can also be submitted on a single
repository between two branches.  

Github also has features that allow us to easily compare changes. We can do this on the command line the same way we diff two branches:

Or we can use the github GUI.

tips:
* always pull down fresh changes from master before you branch.
* branching is powerful because you

# 8.0 A few extra git things!

#### Aliases

Sometimes we find ourselves looking up the same git command over and over again
on stackoverflow. We can customize git with aliases, or shortcuts that are
associated with a a particular configured command. For example, I use `git
checkout -b [mynewbranchname]` a lot, so i could alias this with

```
git config --global alias.sprout "checkout -b"
```

If you're prone to typos, it can be helpful to alias those too!

```
git config --global alias.connit "commit"
```

As with other config options, we can check our aliases with
`git config --list`.
If we have a lot of config options, we can further pipe that to filter out only
alias commands with `git config --list | grep alias`

#### Work in progress

What if you're working on something and somebody pushes changes to your project
remote that are important to what you're doing? You could commit with a work in
progress commit, but maybe that's not helpful to you right now. Enter `git
stash`. What stashing does is "stashes" your changes in your repository and
cleans your working area. What this looks like in practice is:

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   cats.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: f7ae976 making notes on cats

$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

We can unstash our changes

#### Editing a commit

What if you've committed something and realized you've made an error in your
commit? Maybe you misspelled something in the commit message? Maybe you forgot
to add a closing curly brace at the end of a dictionary in your code?
Enter `git commit --amend`

######  Scenario 1: fixing a commit message

Let's say that I accidentally mess up my commit message

```
$ git commit -m 'this commit is missssspelled'
[master c86fefb] this commit is missssspelled
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

I can use `git commit --amend` immediately after to pop into most recent commit
message file and edit it. (note: just like with git commit on its own,
this will
pop you into your chosen text editor that you specified at the beginning of the
lesson). After we close out and save, git will tell us about our amended
message.

```
$ git commit --amend
[master 59a2d70] this commit is not misspelled anymore!
 Date: Sun Jan 13 22:48:30 2019 -0600
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
*note that the commit hash has changed from **c86fefb** to **59a2d70** in
this example*

######  Scenario 2: Adding additional changes to the most recent commit

Let's say now that I also forgot to add some changes that I wanted to include in
my commit. I can again use `git commit --amend` to update my commit. This is the
process I'd need to follow:
```
$ git add cats.md
$ git commit --amend
[master 4e624b8] this commit is not misspelled anymore!
 Date: Sun Jan 13 22:48:30 2019 -0600
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

Again, when I execute the --amend command I am put into my text editor so I
could additionally modify the commit message if necessary.

*note that the commit hash has changed from **59a2d70** to **4e624b8** with this second amend*

Note: because amending a commit changes the hash associated with the commit, if
you've pushed changes up to github already you'll need to *force push* to
"rewrite history".

#### Adding only part of a file to the staging area

What if you've modified a file in a few locations and realize that part of your
work thematically would be better in a different commit? What if your text
editor deletes whitespaces at the end of lines and you don't want to commit
that? We can interactively add part of the file with `git add --patch
<filename>`

When this command is executed, git go through, chunk by chunk, and ask you if
you'd like to add this file or not to the staging area with: `Stage this hunk
[y,n,q,a,d,/,j,J,g,s,e,?]?`

The options are as follows:
* y stage this hunk for the next commit
* q quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
* a stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
* d do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
* g select a hunk to go to
/ search for a hunk matching the given regex
* j leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
* J leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
* k leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
* K leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
* s split the current hunk into smaller hunks
* e manually edit the current hunk
* ? print hunk help

When you're finished, you'll see with `git status` that the file is both in the
staging area and not in staging.

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   cats.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   cats.md
```
