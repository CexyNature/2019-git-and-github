# 6.0 Remotes

Covered commands + concepts:
* `git remote add [name] [url]`
* `git pull`
* `git push`
* `git fetch` and `git merge`

When we use git in conjunction with remotes, we use a few more commands. `git remote` will list all of our remotes by name. If we want to know a bit more about them (like what URL each is associated with), we can use `git remote -v`.
