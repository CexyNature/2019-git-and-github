# 8.0 A few extra git things!

#### Aliases

Sometimes we find ourselves looking up the same git command over and over again
on stackoverflow. We can customize git with aliases, or shortcuts that are
associated with a a particular configured command. For example, I use `git
checkout -b [mynewbranchname]` a lot, so i could alias this with

```
git config --global alias.sprout "checkout -b"
```

If you're prone to typos, it can be helpful to alias those too!

```
git config --global alias.connit "commit"
```

As with other config options, we can check our aliases with
`git config --list`.
If we have a lot of config options, we can further pipe that to filter out only
alias commands with `git config --list | grep alias`

#### Work in progress

What if you're working on something and somebody pushes changes to your project
remote that are important to what you're doing? You could commit with a work in
progress commit, but maybe that's not helpful to you right now. Enter `git
stash`. What stashing does is "stashes" your changes in your repository and
cleans your working area. What this looks like in practice is:

```
$ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   cats.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

$ git stash
Saved working directory and index state WIP on master: f7ae976 making notes on cats

$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

We can unstash our changes

#### Editing a commit

What if you've committed something and realized you've made an error in your
commit? Maybe you misspelled something in the commit message? Maybe you forgot
to add a closing curly brace at the end of a dictionary in your code?
Enter `git commit --amend`

######  Scenario 1: fixing a commit message

Let's say that I accidentally mess up my commit message

```
$ git commit -m 'this commit is missssspelled'
[master c86fefb] this commit is missssspelled
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

I can use `git commit --amend` immediately after to pop into most recent commit
message file and edit it. (note: just like with git commit on its own,
this will
pop you into your chosen text editor that you specified at the beginning of the
lesson). After we close out and save, git will tell us about our amended
message.

```
$ git commit --amend
[master 59a2d70] this commit is not misspelled anymore!
 Date: Sun Jan 13 22:48:30 2019 -0600
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```
*note that the commit hash has changed from **c86fefb** to **59a2d70** in
this example*

######  Scenario 2: Adding additional changes to the most recent commit

Let's say now that I also forgot to add some changes that I wanted to include in
my commit. I can again use `git commit --amend` to update my commit. This is the
process I'd need to follow:
```
$ git add cats.md
$ git commit --amend
[master 4e624b8] this commit is not misspelled anymore!
 Date: Sun Jan 13 22:48:30 2019 -0600
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

Again, when I execute the --amend command I am put into my text editor so I
could additionally modify the commit message if necessary.

*note that the commit hash has changed from **59a2d70** to **4e624b8** with this second amend*

Note: because amending a commit changes the hash associated with the commit, if
you've pushed changes up to github already you'll need to *force push* to
"rewrite history".

#### Adding only part of a file to the staging area

What if you've modified a file in a few locations and realize that part of your
work thematically would be better in a different commit? What if your text
editor deletes whitespaces at the end of lines and you don't want to commit
that? We can interactively add part of the file with `git add --patch
<filename>`

When this command is executed, git go through, chunk by chunk, and ask you if
you'd like to add this file or not to the staging area with: `Stage this hunk
[y,n,q,a,d,/,j,J,g,s,e,?]?`

The options are as follows:
* y stage this hunk for the next commit
* q quit; do not stage this hunk or any of the remaining hunks
* a stage this hunk and all later hunks in the file
* d do not stage this hunk or any of the later hunks in the file
* g select a hunk to go to
/ search for a hunk matching the given regex
* j leave this hunk undecided, see next undecided hunk
* J leave this hunk undecided, see next hunk
* k leave this hunk undecided, see previous undecided hunk
* K leave this hunk undecided, see previous hunk
* s split the current hunk into smaller hunks
* e manually edit the current hunk
* ? print hunk help

When you're finished, you'll see with `git status` that the file is both in the
staging area and not in staging.

```
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   cats.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

	modified:   cats.md
```
